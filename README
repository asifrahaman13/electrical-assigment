1)The assignment:

a) install yodel  (https://pypi.org/project/yodel/)
b) go through the demo fourier_analysis.py
c) implement a frequency equalizer for a stored voice signal (https://publish.illinois.edu/augmentedlistening/tutorials/music-processing/tutorial-1-introduction-to-audio-processing-in-python/)
d) implement a filter using inverse Fourier transform to suppress a few frequency components from the desired signal (hint: already a part of the demo of Yodel)


2)install the libraries with the following commands:

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy IPython

3)Two audio files are provided for demonstration purposes:
1.first.wav
2.second.wav
